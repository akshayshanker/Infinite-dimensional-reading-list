# Infinite-dimensional-reading-list

This is a list of papers with models that track an infinite dimensional distribution through time. 

The focus is mostly on heterogeneous agent models, models of industry dynamics, endogenous growth models or search models. Standard stochastic growth or asset pricing models are generally excluded unless particularly interesting. 


Most papers are from 2012 and from the following journals:

--- Econometrica

--- Journal of Economic Theory

--- Quarterly Journal of Economics

--- American Economic Review

--- Journal of Political Economy

--- Review of Economic Dynamics 

--- Joural of Monetary Economics


The list contains paper title, authors, date, the type of infinite dimensional distribution (e.g. wealth distribution) and in many cases, 
a summary of the contribution. 

Additions of good papers to the reading list and amendments too summaries of contribution are welcome. 

Thank you to John Stachurski for supporting the project.
